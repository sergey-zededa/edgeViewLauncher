+ no device list is available at application start
+ connect option should not be available for offline nodes
+ need to disable OS integrated autocorrect in the search field
+ Enable SSH does not work
+ "No apps found" - "Error: failed to query device: failed to read response: read tcp 192.168.0.97:62706->104.18.3.204:443: i/o timeout"
+ change SSH Terminal to EVE-OS SSH terminal (use icon from eve)
+ align terminal options left
+ edgeView active sessions and limits to be displayed
+ align SSH ACCESS and Running services in terms of styling and alignment
+ support multiple cluster configs (URL/Token pairs) and switching between them
+ make sure there is a way to navigate back from config page without saving, now the only option to close cluster config is to "Save configuration"
+ update device list after config save/switching to another cluster
+ limit recent devices list to top 10 recent devices
+ make device to recent not on SSH activation but on going to the details page
+ icon need to be updated
+ Implement auto refresh of list of devices and status every 10-15 seconds in the background
+ show currently active peers/instances?
+ Add Activity log messages on tunnel activation/deactivation and other important activities which are not yet logged
+ No EdgeView reset option anymore?
+ Shows Scanning services with spinning icon on VNC/Tunnel activation instead of relevant message about activating tunnel
+ Closing the sessions using UI results in following errors:
DEBUG: Sending 695 bytes to EdgeView via WebSocket (tcpData JSON: 977 bytes)
API call error: Error: missing tunnel ID
+ Add space to "EdgeView session active(expires: 11/29/2025, 1:19:22 AM)" between "active" and "(expires:"

+ multiple icons are rotating when either of Connect options is selected (TCP/VNC/SSH)
+ And VNC connection is still failing BTW:
+ noVNC wiring?
+ app need to live in the tray
+ No number of allowed connections anymore?
+ !!!save config does not work in windows 
+ remove chromium menu items (devtools, etc)
+ I noted are we requesting for an edge view script "[Go Backend] Waiting for EdgeView script...", don't we receive token info already here: "[Go Backend] DEBUG: edgeviewconfig: map[appPolicy:map[allowApp:true] devPolicy:map[allowDev:true] extPolicy:map[allowExt:false] generationId:4 jwtInfo:map[allowSec:18000 authen:EvAuth_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED dispUrl:https://zedcloud.hummingbird.zededa.net/api/v1/edge-view encrypt:false expireSec:1764541644 numInst:3] requireControllerAuthen:false token:eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdXQiOjAsImRlcCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vemVkY2xvdWQuaHVtbWluZ2JpcmQuemVkZWRhLm5ldC9hcGkvdjEvZWRnZS12aWV3IiwiZW5jIjpmYWxzZSwiZXhwIjoxNzY0NTQxNjQ0LCJrZXkiOiJja3ZrbHFxamJnc3QiLCJudW0iOjMsInN1YiI6ImU5YzJjMTlkLWNlNWEtNGE5NC1hMDYzLTExYTYwNDU2ZjFhNCJ9.SI_fXL-TJqOebZCtlqQQtn26ixFUnodbFFYoQD_qTBaNPTqHUUhdhD039myLubo097SAV1WHDmldxgRyWNyZxA]"
Is there any additional info we need to get from parsing the script which we don't receive from the API already?
+ Options to enable USB, VGA and console
+ fix the back arrow overlapping with traffic lights on the device details page header
+ add status message on failing to connect to the controller/cluster when receiving the list of devices
+ make the backend port dynamic? Not hard coded 8080
+ Autosize VNC window to fit all the original remote screen content and our added UI elements (i.e. keyboard options, etc.)


+ auto day/night scheme in line with OS ??? Need to test
- ? need an option to select preferred terminal app
- ? Helper strings to show how to connect to a tunnel/platform dependent
- number of AVAILABLE connections/instances?
- remove Standard window headers/menus in Windows

UI:
- when Application Window closes I need App Icon to disappear from MacOS dock only leaving it present/resident in the system tray
- System tray menu is to show minimalistic list of currently established global connections and some other useful info similar to Tailscale menu
- make sure Activity log captures all necessary events/messages
- add close button to VNC window similar to what we have in SSH Terminal window
- Move searching devices on app start a little lower, it is too close to window header
- Add logged in user info on the top of device search page (token owner)
- Rename "Global Tunnels" to "All Tunnels", add tooltip explaining this would show all tunnels opened across all the devices at the moment.
- Reduce Debug logging ("TUNNEL[tunnel-1764919396970952000] Failed to parse tcpData")

Tunneling/EdgeView
- Ensure stable VNC connection
- Indicate VNC/SSH/TCP tunnel status/liveliness (running, data is transferring, etc) in per device and global tunnel lists. Do not overcomplicate or over engineer, I need user some clear indication if data is flowing over the tunnel and it looks alive or not (like traffic light blinking or brief info about connection speed in kbps or something similar per best practices).
- Need to implement "collect info" edge view function with capability to locally download the generated TAR file with proper progress display.
- file transfers?
- secure edgeview support?

Core:
- settings to be stored securely (use keyring or other relevant OS features)


- >>>Antigravity>>> instead of checking cluster access for validity, which always fails, explore if we can display cluster access token validity time (if available/readable from token or API) and mark it red if expired - can we fetch this info from API? -check https://zedcontrol.zededa.net/api/v1/docs/?urls.primaryName=ZEDEDA%20IAM%20Service#/IdentityAccessManagement/IdentityAccessManagement_GetUserSession /v1/sessions/token/{sessionToken.base64}
