+ no device list is available at application start
+ connect option should not be available for offline nodes
+ need to disable OS integrated autocorrect in the search field
+ Enable SSH does not work
+ "No apps found" - "Error: failed to query device: failed to read response: read tcp 192.168.0.97:62706->104.18.3.204:443: i/o timeout"
+ change SSH Terminal to EVE-OS SSH terminal (use icon from eve)
+ align terminal options left
+ edgeView active sessions and limits to be displayed
+ align SSH ACCESS and Running services in terms of styling and alignment
+ support multiple cluster configs (URL/Token pairs) and switching between them
+ make sure there is a way to navigate back from config page without saving, now the only option to close cluster config is to "Save configuration"
+ update device list after config save/switching to another cluster
+ limit recent devices list to top 10 recent devices
+ make device to recent not on SSH activation but on going to the details page
+ icon need to be updated
+ Implement auto refresh of list of devices and status every 10-15 seconds in the background
+ show currently active peers/instances?
+ Add Activity log messages on tunnel activation/deactivation and other important activities which are not yet logged
+ No EdgeView reset option anymore?
+ Shows Scanning services with spinning icon on VNC/Tunnel activation instead of relevant message about activating tunnel
+ Closing the sessions using UI results in following errors:
DEBUG: Sending 695 bytes to EdgeView via WebSocket (tcpData JSON: 977 bytes)
API call error: Error: missing tunnel ID
+ Add space to "EdgeView session active(expires: 11/29/2025, 1:19:22 AM)" between "active" and "(expires:"
+ [8:29:44 PM]EdgeView session active(expires: 11/29/2025, 1:19:22 AM) - use local OS time setting to display in the same format (24 vs 12h)


- app need to live in the tray
- settings to be stored securely (use keyring or other relevant OS features)

+ auto day/night scheme in line with OS ??? Need to test
- ? need an option to select preferred terminal app
- ? Helper strings to show how to connect to a tunnel/platform dependent
- No number of allowed connections anymore?
- noVNC wiring?
- !!!save config does not work in windows 

- >>>Antigravity>>> instead of checking cluster access for validity, which always fails, explore if we can display cluster access token validity time (if available/readable from token or API) and mark it red if expired - can we fetch this info from API? -check https://zedcontrol.zededa.net/api/v1/docs/?urls.primaryName=ZEDEDA%20IAM%20Service#/IdentityAccessManagement/IdentityAccessManagement_GetUserSession /v1/sessions/token/{sessionToken.base64}

- add status message on failing to connect to the controller/cluster when receiving the list of devices

- Why are we requesting for an edge view script "[Go Backend] Waiting for EdgeView script...", don't we receive token info already here: "[Go Backend] DEBUG: edgeviewconfig: map[appPolicy:map[allowApp:true] devPolicy:map[allowDev:true] extPolicy:map[allowExt:false] generationId:4 jwtInfo:map[allowSec:18000 authen:EvAuth_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED dispUrl:https://zedcloud.hummingbird.zededa.net/api/v1/edge-view encrypt:false expireSec:1764541644 numInst:3] requireControllerAuthen:false token:eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdXQiOjAsImRlcCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vemVkY2xvdWQuaHVtbWluZ2JpcmQuemVkZWRhLm5ldC9hcGkvdjEvZWRnZS12aWV3IiwiZW5jIjpmYWxzZSwiZXhwIjoxNzY0NTQxNjQ0LCJrZXkiOiJja3ZrbHFxamJnc3QiLCJudW0iOjMsInN1YiI6ImU5YzJjMTlkLWNlNWEtNGE5NC1hMDYzLTExYTYwNDU2ZjFhNCJ9.SI_fXL-TJqOebZCtlqQQtn26ixFUnodbFFYoQD_qTBaNPTqHUUhdhD039myLubo097SAV1WHDmldxgRyWNyZxA]"


- Indicate VNC/SSH/TCP tunnel status/liveliness (running, data is transferring, etc). Do not overcomplicate or over engineer, I need user some clear indication if data is flowing over the tunnel and it looks alive or not.
- collect info
- multiple icons are rotating when either of Connect options is selected (TCP/VNC/SSH)
